v1.05 changelog:
- Error message now shows correctly on wrong input on the main menu.
- Fixed a bug in the definition of the "Ba" ("Barren") trade code. Should now appear correctly.

v1.0 notes:
- First full-scale stable release
- Tested on Windows 7 64bit
- This is a remake of an old script I built in 2010. I tried writing a much clearer, readable, better-documented code and avoid the programming mistakes I commited in my old script.
