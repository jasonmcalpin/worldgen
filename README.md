- Thanks to Leam Hall and other very kind people for their input!

v1.1 changelog:
- Fixed a major bug where an empty string would have been generated instead of a trade code when there was a single trade code.
- Population numbers can no longer be negative.

v1.05 changelog:
- Error message now shows correctly on wrong input on the main menu.

v1.0 notes:
- First full-scale stable release
- Tested on Windows 7 64bit
- This is a remake of an old script I built in 2010. I tried writing a much clearer, readable, better-documented code and avoid the programming mistakes I commited in my old script.
